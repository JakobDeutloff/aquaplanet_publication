This repository contains the code to reproduce the figures and numbers from Deutloff et al., 2025 "Intensified Diurnal Cycle of Convection Explains Nearly Half of Tropical High-Cloud Feedback". To run the code, please follow the instructions below.

## Get Started
You will need to download the data that is published alongside the paper. The data can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17472593).
You will need to modify the `get_path` function in `src/read_data.py` to point to the location where you have stored the data.
